# Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition

## Overview
The **Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition** is a cutting-edge solution designed to automate and simplify the process of managing attendance in academic institutions, workplaces, and other organizations. By leveraging advanced facial recognition technology, this system ensures accurate and efficient attendance tracking while eliminating the need for traditional manual methods.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Identify and verify individuals based on their facial features.
- **Automated Attendance Marking**: Automatically mark attendance for recognized individuals.
- **Database Integration**: Store and manage user data and attendance records securely.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instantly process face recognition and update attendance records.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for administrators and users.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small teams to large organizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV: For image and video processing
  - NumPy: For numerical operations
  - dlib or Face Recognition Library: For face detection and recognition
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL (depending on preference)
- **Frontend**: Tkinter (for desktop UI) or a web framework (e.g., Flask/Django for web-based UI)
- **Hardware**: Webcam or external camera for face capture

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
1. Python 3.6 or above
2. Required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy dlib face-recognition tkinter
   ```
3. Database setup (SQLite/MySQL):
   - For SQLite: No additional setup is required.
   - For MySQL: Ensure MySQL server is installed and running.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd attendance-management-system
   ```
3. Initialize the database:
   - If using SQLite, run the provided script:
     ```bash
     python initialize_db.py
     ```
   - For MySQL, execute the provided SQL schema using a database client.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Registration**:
   - Use the "Register" feature to add new users.
   - Capture and store the face data for each user.

2. **Mark Attendance**:
   - The system will automatically detect faces through the camera.
   - Recognized faces will be marked as "Present" in the attendance records.

3. **View Records**:
   - Administrators can view, export, and manage attendance data through the interface.
